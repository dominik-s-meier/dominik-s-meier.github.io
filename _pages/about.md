I'm currently a postdoc at the [Center for Philanthropy Studies (CEPS)](https://ceps.unibas.ch/en/) and a visiting researcher at the [Gradel Institute of Charity (Oxford)](https://www.gradelinstituteofcharity.co.uk). 

I use [big data](https://doi.org/10.1177/08997640231185119), [machine learning and natural language processign](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/283363/1/1844747557.pdf) to study individual and institutional philanthropy. 

I am also interested in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially in [how philanthropy can contribute to achieving the SDGs](https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2023.2236501). As part of this interest, I helped [co-develop](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05856) and [validate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11353) a machine learning algorithm that [detects SDGs in text](https://www.text2sdg.io).
